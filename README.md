**üìà Correlation Coefficient Analysis:**
The system employs Pearson correlation coefficients (r ‚àà [-1.0, 1.0]) to quantify linear relationships between feature pairs. Optimal feature selection occurs when variables demonstrate minimal correlation (approaching r = 0), indicating independent predictive value. Strong correlations (|r| > 0.7) may suggest redundant features requiring dimensionality reduction.


## üéØ Feature Significance Assessment

The platform integrates sophisticated **model interpretability frameworks** designed to illuminate the relative importance of statistical variables in predictive accuracy. This analytical capability addresses the critical question: "Which performance metrics drive the most reliable predictions?"

**üîç Multi-Method Importance Evaluation:**
- **Variance Analysis:** Statistical variance decomposition to identify high-impact variables
- **Recursive Feature Elimination:** Systematic backward selection using cross-validated performance metrics  
- **Tree-Based Importance Scoring:** Random Forest-derived feature ranking through impurity reduction analysis


## ‚öñÔ∏è Class Distribution & Imbalance Management

Dataset analysis reveals that numerous soccer leagues exhibit **inherent class imbalances**, where home team victories significantly outnumber away team successes. This statistical skew can introduce systematic bias into machine learning models, leading to overconfident predictions favoring home teams.

**üìä Imbalance Detection & Visualization:**

8. **Deep Neural Networks** - Multi-layer artificial neural architectures

## üå≤ Ensemble Forest Training Methodology

The Random Forest implementation leverages **bootstrap aggregating (bagging)** combined with random feature selection to create robust ensemble predictions. This approach reduces overfitting while maintaining high predictive accuracy across diverse league characteristics.

**üîó Algorithmic Details:** [Random Forest Implementation Guide](https://www.section.io/engineering-education/introduction-to-random-forest-in-machine-learning/)


## üé≠ Hybrid Ensemble Architecture

The ensemble methodology represents an advanced **meta-learning approach** that synthesizes predictions from multiple algorithmic sources. While individual models like Random Forest and Neural Networks may demonstrate comparable performance under optimal tuning, prediction divergence scenarios often arise where different algorithms assign varying confidence levels to the same outcome.

**üîÑ Voting Mechanism:**
The ensemble framework employs **weighted probability averaging** across constituent models, leveraging the collective intelligence of diverse algorithmic perspectives. This approach capitalizes on the principle that individual model biases can be mitigated through strategic combination, resulting in superior predictive robustness.

## üìä Model Performance Evaluation

Comprehensive model assessment constitutes a critical phase before deployment in live prediction scenarios. The evaluation framework provides detailed insights into model reliability, prediction confidence distributions, and performance characteristics across different match contexts.

**üéØ Multi-Dimensional Assessment:**
- **Cross-Model Comparison:** Systematic analysis of prediction agreement between different algorithms
- **Confidence Interval Analysis:** Statistical evaluation of prediction certainty levels
- **Stratified Performance Reports:** Accuracy metrics segmented by betting odds ranges and team strength categories


## üîÆ Match Outcome Prediction Engine

The prediction interface requires specification of **competing teams and current betting odds** to generate comprehensive match forecasts. Optimal prediction reliability occurs when multiple models demonstrate consensus; divergent predictions across algorithms typically indicate higher uncertainty scenarios requiring cautious interpretation.

**üìà Prediction Categories:**
1. **Match Result Classification:** Home Victory / Draw / Away Victory
2. **Goal Total Forecasting:** Over 2.5 Goals / Under 2.5 Goals

## üìÖ Automated Fixture Processing

![gui](https://github.com/gregorizeidler-cw/footyforecast-soccer-bets-predictor/blob/main/Pictures/loaded_league.png)

## League Statistics

For each league, the application computes several statistics (features) about the teams, including their form, the performance of the last N matches, etc. The stats are computed for both the home team and the away team. More specifically:

1. **Home Wins (HW)**: Last N wins of the home team in its home
2. **Home Losses (HL)**: Last N losses of the home team in its home
3. **Home Goal Forward (HGF)**: Sum of goals that the home team scored in the last N matches in its home
4. **Home Goal Against (HGA)**: Sum of goals that the away teams scored in the last N matches.
5. **Home G-Goal Difference Wins (HGD-W)** Last N wins of the home team with G difference in the final score in its home (${HG - AG ‚â• 2}$)
6. **Home G-Goal Difference Losses (HGD-L)** Last N losses of the home team with G difference in the final score in its home (${HG - AG ‚â• 2}$)
7. **Home Win Rate (HW%)** Total win rate of the home team from the start of the league in its home
8. **Home Loss Rate (HL%)** Total loss rate of the home team from the start of the league in its home
9. **Away Wins (AW)**: Last N wins of the away team away its home
10. **Away Losses (AL)**: Last N losses of the away team away its home
11. **Away Goal Forward (AGF)**: Sum of goals that the away team scored in the last N matches away its home
12. **Away Goal Against (AGA)**: Sum of goals that the home teams scored in the last N matches.
13. **Away G-Goal Difference Wins (AGD-W)** Last N wins of the away team with G difference in the final score away its home(${HG - AG ‚â• 2}$)
14. **Away G-Goal Difference Losses (AGD-L)** Last N losses of the away team with G difference in the final score away its home (${HG - AG ‚â• 2}$)
15. **Away Win Rate (AW%)** Total win rate from the start of the league away its home
16. **Away Loss Rate (AL%)** Total loss rate from the start of the league away its home

Each column can be added or removed from a league during the creating phase.

## Leagues

FootyForecast provides 11 main soccer leagues and 2 extras, which are downloaded by https://www.football-data.co.uk/. More specifically, these leagues are:

* 'Argentina': [PrimeraDivision]
* 'Belgium': [JupilerLeague]
* 'Brazil': [BrazilSerieA]
* 'China': [ChinaSuperLeague]
* 'Denmark': [SuperLiga]
* 'England': [PremierLeague, Championship, League1, League2]
* 'Finland': [VeikkausLiiga]
* 'France': [Ligue1, Ligue2]
* 'Germany': [Bundesliga1, Bundesliga2]
* 'Greece': [SuperLeague]
* 'Ireland': [IrelandPremierDivision]
* 'Italy': [SerieA, SerieB]
* 'Japan': [J1]
* 'Mexico': [LigaMX]
* 'Netherlands': [Eredivisie]
* 'Norway': [Eliteserien]
* 'Poland': [Ekstraklasa]
* 'Portugal': [Liga1]
* 'Romania': [RomaniaLiga1]
* 'Russia': [RussiaPremierLeague]
* 'Scotland': [Premiership]
* 'Spain': [LaLiga, SegundaDivision]
* 'Sweden': [Allsvenskan]
* 'Switzerland': [SwitzerlandSuperLeague]
* 'USA': [MLS]
* 'Turkey': [SuperLig]

You can add additional leagues by modifying the `database/leagues.csv` configuration file. In order to add a new league, you need to specify:

1. Country (The country of the league, e.g. Russia)
2. League Name (The name of the league e.g. Premier League)
3. League ID: You can create multiple leagues, but with different ID.
4. The statistical odds that will be used to train the models.

## Feature Correlation Analysis

This is particularly useful when analyzing the quality of the training data. FootyForecast provides a heatmap for the correlation matrix between the features, which shows the correlations between 2 features (columns). The correlation is described by an arithmetic value ${r ‚àà [-1.0, 1.0]}$. The closer $r$ is to zero, the weaker the correlation is between 2 columns. The closer to 1.0 or -1.0, the stronger the correlation will be. Ideally, a feature is good if its correlation with the rest of the features is close to zero ($r=0$).

![correlation heatmap analysis](https://github.com/gregorizeidler-cw/footyforecast-soccer-bets-predictor/blob/main/Pictures/correlations.png)

## Feature Importance Analysis

FootyForecast also comes with a built-in module for "**interpretability**". In case you are wondering which stats are the most important, there are 3 methods included:

1. Variance Analysis (https://corporatefinanceinstitute.com/resources/knowledge/accounting/variance-analysis/)
2. Recursive Feature Elimination (https://bookdown.org/max/FES/recursive-feature-elimination.html)
3. Random Forest importance scores

![feature-importance-analysis](https://github.com/gregorizeidler-cw/footyforecast-soccer-bets-predictor/blob/main/Pictures/importance.png)

## Class (Target) Distribution Analysis

It is noticed that the training dataset of several leagues contains imbalanced classes, which means that the number of matches that ended in a win for the home team is a lot larger than the number of the matches that ended in a win for the away team. This often leads models to overestimate their prediction probabilities and tend to have a bias towards the home team. FootyForecast provides a plot to detect such leagues, using the **Target Distribution Plot**, as well as several tools to deal with that, including:

1. Noise Injection (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2771718/)
2. Output Probability Calibration (https://davidrosenberg.github.io/ttml2021/calibration/2.calibration.pdf)
3. Resampling techniques (SMOTE, SMOTE-NN, SVM-SMOTE, NearMiss, Random Resampling)

![class distribution](https://github.com/gregorizeidler-cw/footyforecast-soccer-bets-predictor/blob/main/Pictures/targets.png)

## Training Deep Neural Networks

A detailed description of neural networks can be found in the link below:
https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/neuralnetwork.asp

![deep neural networks](https://github.com/gregorizeidler-cw/footyforecast-soccer-bets-predictor/blob/main/Pictures/neuralnetwork.png)

## Machine Learning Models

1. K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
2. Logistic Regression
3. Naive Bayes
4. Decision Tree
5. Random Forest
6. XG-Boost
7. Support Vector Machine (SVM)
8. Deep Neural Networks

## Training Random Forests

A detailed description of random forests can be found in the link below:
https://www.section.io/engineering-education/introduction-to-random-forest-in-machine-learning/

![random forests](https://github.com/gregorizeidler-cw/footyforecast-soccer-bets-predictor/blob/main/Pictures/randomforest.png)

## The Ensemble Model

This type combines the predictions of several machine learning models. Typically, a well tuned Random Forest could generate similar predictions with a Neural Network or any other ML model. However, there are some cases where 2 models could output different output probabilities (e.g. Random Forest might give higher probability that an outcome is Home). In that case, the ensemble model (Voting Model) can be used, which averages the output probabilities of several models and decides on the predicted outcome. The idea is that each model makes unique predictions, so their predictions are combined to form a stronger model.

## Evaluating Models

Before using a trained model, it is wise to first evaluate the model on unseen matches. This should reveal the quality of the model training, as well as its output probabilities. You can compare the probabilities of random forest with the neural network's probabilities and choose the most confident and well-trained model. Additionally, you can request an analytical report of the accuracy of the classifiers for specific odd intervals (e.g. the accuracy between 1.0 and 1.3, 1.3, and 1.6, etc., for the home or away team).

![model evaluation](https://github.com/gregorizeidler-cw/footyforecast-soccer-bets-predictor/blob/main/Pictures/evaluate.png)

## Outcome Predictions

In order to request a prediction for a match, You need to select the home/away team, as well as the book odds. You should use both models to make a prediction. If both models agree, then the prediction should probably be good. If the models disagree, then it's best to avoid betting on that match. The outcome prediction includes:

1. Home, Draw or Away
2. Under (2.5) or Over (2.5)

![match predictions](https://github.com/gregorizeidler-cw/footyforecast-soccer-bets-predictor/blob/main/Pictures/predictions.png)

## Fixture Parsing

An alternative way to predict multiple matches at once is to use the "**Fixture Parsing**" option. You may now automatically parse the fixtures using your browser. Once the fixture window pops-up, select your **browser and the fixture date** and the application will automatically download the page & parse the upcoming fixtures of the specified data. This is a new feature, so please report any bugs in the issues page.
