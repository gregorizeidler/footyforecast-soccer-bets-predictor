## üîó Statistical Correlation Framework

The correlation analysis module serves as a critical component for evaluating dataset integrity and feature relationships. FootyForecast generates interactive correlation matrices that visualize the interdependencies between statistical variables through advanced heatmap representations.

**üìà Correlation Coefficient Analysis:**
The system employs Pearson correlation coefficients (r ‚àà [-1.0, 1.0]) to quantify linear relationships between feature pairs. Optimal feature selection occurs when variables demonstrate minimal correlation (approaching r = 0), indicating independent predictive value. Strong correlations (|r| > 0.7) may suggest redundant features requiring dimensionality reduction.


## üéØ Feature Significance Assessment

The platform integrates sophisticated **model interpretability frameworks** designed to illuminate the relative importance of statistical variables in predictive accuracy. This analytical capability addresses the critical question: "Which performance metrics drive the most reliable predictions?"

**üîç Multi-Method Importance Evaluation:**
- **Variance Analysis:** Statistical variance decomposition to identify high-impact variables
- **Recursive Feature Elimination:** Systematic backward selection using cross-validated performance metrics  
- **Tree-Based Importance Scoring:** Random Forest-derived feature ranking through impurity reduction analysis


## ‚öñÔ∏è Class Distribution & Imbalance Management

Dataset analysis reveals that numerous soccer leagues exhibit **inherent class imbalances**, where home team victories significantly outnumber away team successes. This statistical skew can introduce systematic bias into machine learning models, leading to overconfident predictions favoring home teams.

**üìä Imbalance Detection & Visualization:**
FootyForecast employs **Target Distribution Analysis** to identify and quantify class imbalances across different leagues, providing visual representations of outcome frequency distributions.

**üîß Bias Mitigation Strategies:**
- **Stochastic Noise Injection:** Controlled randomization to improve model generalization
- **Probability Calibration:** Post-processing techniques to adjust prediction confidence levels
- **Advanced Resampling Methods:** SMOTE variants, Near-Miss algorithms, and hybrid sampling approaches


## üß† Deep Learning Architecture Training

FootyForecast implements state-of-the-art **artificial neural network architectures** specifically optimized for soccer match prediction tasks. The deep learning framework supports multi-layer perceptron configurations with customizable activation functions, regularization techniques, and optimization algorithms.

**üîó Technical Reference:** [Neural Network Fundamentals](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/neuralnetwork.asp)

## ü§ñ Machine Learning Algorithm Portfolio

The platform provides access to **eight distinct algorithmic approaches**, each offering unique advantages for different prediction scenarios:

1. **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** - Instance-based learning with distance metrics
2. **Logistic Regression** - Linear probabilistic classification framework
3. **Naive Bayes** - Probabilistic classifier based on Bayes' theorem
4. **Decision Tree** - Rule-based hierarchical decision structures
5. **Random Forest** - Ensemble of decision trees with bootstrap aggregation
6. **XGBoost** - Gradient boosting with advanced regularization
7. **Support Vector Machine (SVM)** - Maximum margin hyperplane optimization
8. **Deep Neural Networks** - Multi-layer artificial neural architectures

## üå≤ Ensemble Forest Training Methodology

The Random Forest implementation leverages **bootstrap aggregating (bagging)** combined with random feature selection to create robust ensemble predictions. This approach reduces overfitting while maintaining high predictive accuracy across diverse league characteristics.

**üîó Algorithmic Details:** [Random Forest Implementation Guide](https://www.section.io/engineering-education/introduction-to-random-forest-in-machine-learning/)


## üé≠ Hybrid Ensemble Architecture

The ensemble methodology represents an advanced **meta-learning approach** that synthesizes predictions from multiple algorithmic sources. While individual models like Random Forest and Neural Networks may demonstrate comparable performance under optimal tuning, prediction divergence scenarios often arise where different algorithms assign varying confidence levels to the same outcome.

**üîÑ Voting Mechanism:**
The ensemble framework employs **weighted probability averaging** across constituent models, leveraging the collective intelligence of diverse algorithmic perspectives. This approach capitalizes on the principle that individual model biases can be mitigated through strategic combination, resulting in superior predictive robustness.

## üìä Model Performance Evaluation

Comprehensive model assessment constitutes a critical phase before deployment in live prediction scenarios. The evaluation framework provides detailed insights into model reliability, prediction confidence distributions, and performance characteristics across different match contexts.

**üéØ Multi-Dimensional Assessment:**
- **Cross-Model Comparison:** Systematic analysis of prediction agreement between different algorithms
- **Confidence Interval Analysis:** Statistical evaluation of prediction certainty levels
- **Stratified Performance Reports:** Accuracy metrics segmented by betting odds ranges and team strength categories


## üîÆ Match Outcome Prediction Engine

The prediction interface requires specification of **competing teams and current betting odds** to generate comprehensive match forecasts. Optimal prediction reliability occurs when multiple models demonstrate consensus; divergent predictions across algorithms typically indicate higher uncertainty scenarios requiring cautious interpretation.

**üìà Prediction Categories:**
1. **Match Result Classification:** Home Victory / Draw / Away Victory
2. **Goal Total Forecasting:** Over 2.5 Goals / Under 2.5 Goals

## üìÖ Automated Fixture Processing

The **Fixture Parsing Module** enables batch prediction capabilities through automated web scraping of upcoming match schedules. This feature streamlines the prediction workflow by eliminating manual fixture entry requirements.

**üîÑ Processing Workflow:**
Users select their preferred web browser and target date, triggering automated page retrieval and fixture extraction for the specified timeframe. The system processes all identified matches and generates comprehensive prediction reports for the entire fixture list.

1. Download & Install python. During the installation, you should choose  **add to "Path"**. It is recommended to download **python 3.9.** or higher version.
2. After you download & install python, you can Download the above libraries using pip module (e.g. `pip install numpy==VERSION`). The version can be found in *requirements.txt* file. These modules can be installed via the cmd (in windows) or terminal (in linux). **IMPORTANT**: To download the correct versions, just add "==" after pip install to specify version, as described on requirements.txt file. For example, to install `tensorflow 2.9.1`, you can use: `pip install tensorflow==2.9.1`.
3. On windows, you can double click the main.py file. Alternatively (Both Windows & Linux), You can open the cmd on the project directory and run: `python main.py`. 

**A `requirements.txt` file has been added to the project directory. The table below presents the required libraries, however, you should check the `requirements.txt` file for the required library versions.**

# Open An Issue
In case there is an error with the application, open a Github Issue so that I can get informed and (resolve the issue if required).

# Known Issues

1. **Neural Network's Training Dialog Height is too large and as a result, "Train" button cannot be displayed.**

Solution: You can press "ENTER" button to start training. The same applies to Random Forest Training Dialog, as well as the tuning dialogs.
